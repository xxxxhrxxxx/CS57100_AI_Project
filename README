Brief:
In this project, we aim to tackle some NP-Hard/Compelete problems using customized Monte Carlo Tree Search and get high-quality and near optimal solutions.

Problem:
Travelling salesman in a maze environment


Overall method:
Use Floyd Warshall algorithm to get the shortest path between any two target locations, which extracts a high-level map for the travelling salesman problem.


Heuristics in MCTS:

Only expand the current node using the K nearest target
